The project aims to build a web-based system for interaction between dental students and patients at Al-Qalamoun University by facilitating and improving the procedures for booking and managing appointments, simplifying and facilitating the communication process between students and patients, and providing an easy-to-use interface for users to achieve quality healthcare for patients at the Faculty of Dentistry at Al-Qalamoun University.
This project introduced a system to automate the communication process between dental students and patients. It allows patients to send a request to a specific student and allows each student to view available patient cases. This system helps to:
• Facilitate communication and coordination between students and patients.
• Develop student skills by providing opportunities for students to train on different dental cases.
• Improve the efficiency of the administrative process by allowing students and patients to manage their personal accounts, schedule appointments, and update information easily.

Functional requirement is a statement of how the system should behave. What are the functions that the system should provide.
For our system, the functions that will be implemented are:
➢ Administrator:
• Login.
• View patient details.
• Delete patient.
• View student details.
• Delete student.
• View student appointments.
• View reservations.
• Delete reservation.
• Accept reservation.
• View student requests. (Accept student request, reject student request)
• Book an appointment with a student.
• Edit supervisor profile.
• Log out.
➢ Student:
• Log in.
• View alerts.
• View student times (add appointment, delete appointment).
• Book an appointment with another student.
• View student reservations (accept reservation, reject reservation).
• Edit student profile.
• Log out.
➢ Patient:
• Log in.
• View reservation status (approved or not).
• Book an appointment.
• View alerts.

• Edit patient profile.
• Send student registration request to system administrator.
• Log out.
➢ Visitor:
• Create an account.
• View student posts.


Non-functional requirements are constraints imposed on the system that define its quality attributes. Non-functional requirements are important because they help ensure that the system meets the user's needs. The following are the non-functional requirements for the proposed system:
• Interfaces that are compatible with all different device screens.
• Speed: The js.react library was used, which will be explained in Chapter 3.
• Compatibility: The system is compatible with different browsers and devices.
• Ease of use: The system is easy to use and includes simple and clear user interfaces.
• Modification: The system can be modified and improved when needed, to better meet the needs of users.
• Security: Each user logs in and users' passwords are encrypted.
